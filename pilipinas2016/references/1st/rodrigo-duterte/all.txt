good day its good that miriam is here shes one of the two only qualified to run this country as president i am here because there is so much criminality drugs are flooding the country calling the attention of the national government and there is so much corruption in government i propose that if i am president i would get rid of criminality drugs and corruption just give me 3-6 months and i will do it for you i will deliver again i said we cannot go for economic growth unless we start with government for as long as there are incompetent and corrupt officials in our government we would never reach our goal of a happy country and so i say that you stand here and you might consider what ive told you this afternoon i will not go into an argument or debate with maam miriam she is telling you the truth and the truth is very important i do not see senator santiago passing away within the next 20 years so whats the problem yes most of it are true most of it are true most of it are true criminals well i go after them as long as i do it in accordance with the rules of law i will kill continue to kill criminals any president can order the killing as long as it is i said in the guise of performance of duty in accordance with law i will tell i will use the military and the police to go after criminality and drugs its flooding the country hindi ako papayag ng ganon totoo yon wala i do not deny anything no im not saying yes no what extra-judicial killing of course not never happened but killings yes if i become president it will be bloody because i will order the killings of all criminals ang mga durugista and drug lords wala akong kaso na ganun i do not know who invented it but i said that mayroon lang akong inakbayan noon ang nanay ko ang nagalit kasi totoo well kung hiwalay ka sa asawa anong gagawin mo sa sarili mo eh anong gawin ko itong karga karga ko di ko naman ipagbili to ni hindi mo nga masanla eh eh gamitin mo dapat kundi mamatay ka lahat naman ito sa kwarto yan hindi mo naman ginagawa sa ano so whats the problem hindi mo naman pina- you dont flaunt it in public and i said if you have to do it i said im separated from my wife and yung isang asawa ko nasa amerika yung nurse so far and wide in between those years its biology actually it is biology oo i cannot rebut yeah i cannot rebut what he has said because its all true gusto ko ngang kopyahin kung papayag siya eh idagdag ko na lang yung akin well i said this is true in every program of government ang problema lang ho kasi dito marami tayong problema in the past there were a lot of problems to help our fellowmen fisheries farmers and all ang nakakaproblema ho dito is in the implementation along the way because if you have incompetent and corrupt officials it will be the same biyayang dagat non was the greatest program of any government but along the way sumabog because of there was corruption maam miriam says it all wala akong debate sa lahat nila problema incompetence sa mga tao and corruption eh hindi yan nako-correct eh sus maam kung yan lang ill do it in 3 days hulihin ko lang yung gagong yun when i testified in the senate i identified somebody there bangayan he was one of those smuggling rice yung cartel nila madali yan as president naku sabi ko nga 3-6 months tapos lahat to eh no really i am willing to stake my honor my position and my life 3-6 months malinis itong bayan na ito pati yung cartel-cartel na yan and even those itong mga 5-6 ang ginagawa nagpapahiram pa doon sa mga farmers tapos binebentahan pa ng appliance kaya ako sa davao sabi ko stop it stop it do not oppress the people kaya lahat ganito we would like to build food terminals we would like to bank ah landbank to come in and give money to the farmers then allow them department of trade to help in the establishment of credit unions cooperatives doon maghiram and i said ang pinakamaganda is 1 billion per region doon sila magtayo ng kooperatiba nila para kanila ang binabayaran nila i have nothing to rebut in that statement if its just a matter of rebutting then its useless because its all good problems i said is the money because ang pinaka with el ni√±o coming in the fundamental duty of a president is see to it that food is available and food is affordable yan ho ang problema talaga yes sir i will have to tell you that 65 or 64 of the infrastructure projects are here in manila i also want you to know that 19 lang ang binigay sa region 19 well of course that is the disparity and that is why the mindanaoans are asking you now if galit na galit si allah kasi ang aming full lawful share sa taxes hindi ibinibigay remember that mindanao contributes to the countrys coffers 54 of the total export earnings in dollars magkano yan well it would depend on not understood but ang mindanao kasi ang nagbibigay sa agricultural products sa country ng ito 19 billion only for region 11 i dont know how much are the others getting yan ho it is this disparity and that is why people are clamoring for a federal government i-dissipate na muna natin yung central powers for after all that is a symbol of our being oppressed as a people a long time ago you have to give us our share and we will and of course you have to restore law and order wala naman akong nakitang tuwid na daan puro kulubot man yan you know i said this year the budget was given to manila the largest portion of it was the 64 ang binigay sa region 11 19 billion kanila 64 o how can you expect mindanao to develop its a question of money you do not count the you do not count the accounts that was given in the last 5 years ah naubos yun sa corruption incompetence let me focus on mindanao on what is happening today with the failure of bbl there is a great great hurt there unless i said we can come up with another card which is federalism nothing nothing at all can appease mindanao yan ang nangyayari diyan and that is why it is very important na kung ako ang pupunta diyan i would not only offer the bbl with the same configuration but i will offer federalism to all pati kay nur misuari on the western side that would maybe appease everybody because every moro politico would really like to see federalism kasi palpak nga ang bbl and we have to do this because i said nothing nothing short will appease and bring peace to mindanao yan ang importante sa lahat diyan you have to right the historical wrong committed against the moro people one hour each were good until 9 give us time to explain further what wed like to present to the people nganong nia man ko diri why am i here i am here because i love my country and i love the people of the philippines i am a native of the philippines there is so much corruption there is so much crime and so much drugs flooding the country and it seems nobody is minding the straw matagal na yan we have been raising that problem and as if every time before a forum we talk about this about that eh kung bigyan ninyo ako ng pagkakataon only if god wills it also i will stop it i said this is an imposed restriction on me hindi ako nagpapabilib sa inyo i will get rid of drugs suppress crime stop corruption in government in a matter of 3 to 6 months because i believe that without peace without with corruption we cannot really survive and develop as a nation
